refreshAll.sh
    -> refreshSynteny.py
	Queries MGI for human/mouse ortholog pairs (with coordinates). From this, derives
	a set of synteny blocks covering the genome. Outputs as SyntenicRegions and 
	ChromosomeLocation objects in ItemXML format.

    -> refreshObo.sh -> ReMOSH.py
	Refreshes ontology files. (GO, MP, MOSH). Downloads obo files for GO and MP.
	Downloads CTD's version of MOSH and runs ReMOSH.py over it, which converts it into
	what we need.

    -> refreshItems.sh -> dumpMgiItemXml.py
    	The main part. Dumps References, Features, Alleles, etc., etc., from MGI in
	ItemXml format. Should run after refreshObo.sh.

    -> refreshItemsSample.sh -> dumpMgiItemXml.py, Sampler.py
	Same as refreshItems.py, but generates only a small sample (by virtue of loading 
	Sampler.py).
